# Lab Project 2: Sampsonâ€™s Monks

# Name: 

# Part 0

# For part 0 of the project, the task was to install and load the lda, igraph, and networkd3 packages to load the required data. 
# Part 1 - Visualizing the Network

Forming the desired matrix that would necessitate running dataframes of nodes and edges, as required by the networkD3. This was done by using the SAMPLK2 Network plot.

# We plot the graph using the Igraph
A Static Visualization of the Monks by using the igraph::plot.igraph() function.

This chart shows that the overall structure of the monks is directed. The arrows indicate which monk is liked by another monk, and the density of the connections implies that the majority of the monks are interconnected. 
However, the ties are not evenly distributed. 
# For the second plot of part 1, the idea was first to create an adjacency matrix, then convert it to nodes and edges data frames that would help to visualize the data interactively.
# Plotting an Interactive plot using networkD3

$average_

From the degree analysis, we see that out-degrees are relatively balanced, with most nodes sending ties to 3 or 4 others, suggesting fairly even outward connectivity. 
However, in-degrees vary more widely, ranging from 1 to 8, indicating that some individuals, for instance, ROMUL_10, BONAVEN_5, are highly popular or central, while others receive few ties. 
The average degree of 1.9474 highlights a moderately sparse network overall, meaning most nodes are connected to only a small fraction of the group, 
reflecting selective or hierarchical relationships rather than widespread interaction. Overall, the average tie strength was 1.9474, and the most liked monk was ROMUL_10, while the least liked monk was AMBROSE_9.

# Part 3 - A Simple Model of a Social Network
For this part, a function was written to generate a random socio matrix. In this function, each monk is assigned likes at random. 
18 monks were used as n, and the probability of liking was set as default (0.3), and the maximum ti strength was also set.

The results with the Monk network showed a clear structure for static and interactive plots. The results of the mean indicated that the tie strength was 1.947, and the most liked monk was ROMUL_10, 
while the least liked monk was AMBROSE_9. The degrees for the random model network were more evenly distributed. This means that no popular or unpopular monks stood out. 
Comparing them with the Sampson's monk structure, they had no strong community structures. Finally, on reflection, 
It was observed that the observed networks had meaningful patterns that were not clear in the generated monks.
